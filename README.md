# About
This project is a 52 deck of cards simulator that resembles typical card actions such as dealing a single card, or multiple cards. It includes a wildcard feature where it randomly adds an extra card to the deck. It contains A pick & switch/toss functionality that
switches the position of the cards, as well as removes the drawn cards completely from the deck.
